# Victory PACs vs. Leadership PACs

Victory PACs (also known as Victory Funds or Joint Fundraising
Committees) can directly transfer funds to individual candidates'
campaign committees, subject to Federal Election Commission (FEC)
contribution limits. They do not have to funnel funds through a
candidate's Leadership PAC, although they could choose to distribute
money to a Leadership PAC as part of their allocation agreement.

### How Victory PACs Work with Individual Candidates

1. **Direct Contributions:** Victory PACs can allocate funds directly to a candidate’s campaign committee. For example, if a joint fundraising committee (Victory PAC) includes a candidate’s campaign committee as a beneficiary, it can transfer funds directly to that committee.
2. **Pre-Set Allocation:** The allocation of funds among all participating committees (e.g., the candidate’s campaign, the national party, state party committees) is determined in advance and disclosed to the FEC.
3. **Contribution Limits:** Contributions to individual candidates from a Victory PAC must adhere to FEC rules:
	- A donor contributing to the Victory PAC can give up to the maximum legal limit to the candidate’s campaign (e.g., $3,300 for the 2024 election cycle, per individual per election, for federal candidates).
	- The Victory PAC then splits and distributes the funds according to its agreed formula.

### Role of Leadership PACs

Leadership PACs are separate entities and are not required to be
involved in Victory PAC fundraising or distributions. However, some
candidates may use their Leadership PACs to: • Provide additional
financial support to their campaign indirectly (e.g., hosting events,
funding strategic activities). • Amplify contributions to other
candidates or causes.

### Summary

Victory PACs can give directly to individual candidates' campaign
committees. They are not obligated to route funds through a Leadership
PAC. The structure of the Victory PAC determines how funds are
allocated, and these allocations must comply with federal contribution
limits and reporting requirements.
