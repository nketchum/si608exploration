# Direct vs Indirect Contributions #

**Direct Contributions:**
- Definition: Contributions made directly to a candidate’s PAC by an individual, corporation (in the case of Super PACs), union, or other entity.
- Characteristics:
- The donor knows their funds are going directly to the candidate’s PAC.
- Subject to legal limits in most cases (e.g., $5,000 per year for regular PACs in federal elections).
- The candidate’s PAC has full control over how these funds are spent (e.g., for campaign activities, advertising, or operational expenses).

**Indirect Contributions:**
- Definition: Contributions made to a third-party organization or entity that supports the candidate, rather than directly to the candidate’s PAC.
- Characteristics:
- Often channeled through Super PACs or other independent groups.
- These entities may spend the money independently on behalf of the candidate (e.g., creating ads or organizing events) without coordinating directly with the candidate’s campaign or PAC.
- No contribution limits apply to Super PACs, but they cannot coordinate directly with the candidate or their official PAC.
- May also involve donations to non-profit organizations or committees that later funnel resources toward activities benefiting the candidate indirectly.
